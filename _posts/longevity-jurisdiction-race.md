Somewhere around 2023, a group of longevity researchers, biohackers, and governance experimentalists started gathering on a small island off the coast of Honduras. The project was called Vitalia, and its thesis was simple but ambitious: the biggest obstacle to radical life extension is not scientific knowledge — it is regulation. If you could build a jurisdiction specifically designed to accelerate longevity research, you could shave decades off the timeline to defeat aging.

For a while, it worked. Vitalia attracted serious talent, serious money, and serious attention. It became the most visible experiment at the intersection of longevity science and jurisdictional innovation.

Then, in January 2025, the founding team split.

<div class="callout reveal">
<strong>Key Insight</strong>
<p>The Vitalia split created two competing visions for how to build a longevity jurisdiction — one rooted in physical charter city infrastructure, the other in distributed network state community-building. The divergence is now a live experiment in governance strategy.</p>
</div>

Niklas Anzinger stayed in Prospera, Honduras, and doubled down on the charter city model. His project became Infinita City. Laurence Ion packed up and moved to San Francisco, launching Viva City with a different theory of how to get the same thing done. Both projects share the same ultimate goal — a place where death is optional — but their strategies for getting there have diverged so fundamentally that they now represent two competing visions for the future of governance-led science.

This is a story about that divergence, and why it matters far beyond longevity.

## Infinita City: The Charter City Bet

Infinita City is the project that kept its feet on the ground — literally. It operates inside Prospera, the ZEDE (Zone for Employment and Economic Development) on the island of Roatan, Honduras. Prospera is arguably the most ambitious charter city experiment currently running anywhere in the world: a semi-autonomous jurisdiction with its own legal code, its own regulatory framework, and its own dispute resolution system, all nested within the sovereign territory of Honduras.

For a longevity-focused community, this setup is extraordinarily attractive. Prospera's regulatory sandbox allows for biotech experimentation that would face years of bureaucratic delay in the United States or Europe. You can actually run trials, test therapies, and iterate on protocols in something close to real time.

</figure>

The numbers tell a story of genuine traction. Infinita City has 89 permanent residents — not just visitors passing through a popup village, but people who live and work there. Over 1,134 builders have visited. Twenty-one startups have received funding. The community has collectively raised $25 million. Those are not theoretical numbers. That is an operational research community.

<div class="stat-banner reveal">
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">89</span><span class="stat-label">Permanent Residents</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">$25M</span><span class="stat-label">Raised</span></div>

<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">$88,888</span><span class="stat-label">Citizenship Cost</span></div>
</div>

The economic model is built around the $LIVES token, and citizenship costs $88,888 — a deliberately high bar designed to filter for committed participants rather than curious tourists. Physical infrastructure is materializing too: the Duna Tower in the Beta District represents serious capital deployment into permanent facilities.

Infinita has built real programs around its regulatory advantages. The Infinite Games longevity competition creates structured incentives for life-extension research. The BioHub Startup Accelerator provides the standard startup infrastructure — funding, mentorship, workspace — but inside a regulatory environment that lets biotech startups move at a pace impossible in conventional jurisdictions.

The supporter list reads like a who's-who of the technology-meets-longevity world: Tim Draper, Balaji Srinivasan, Brian Armstrong, Naval Ravikant, Bryan Johnson, and Aubrey de Grey have all backed the project in various capacities. That kind of name recognition brings capital, talent, and credibility — all of which are essential for a project that needs the mainstream world to eventually take it seriously.

<div class="section-divider"></div>

### The Honduras Problem

But Infinita City has a problem, and it is a big one. The entire project is built on top of Prospera, and Prospera is in a legal fight for its life.

The Honduran government has declared ZEDEs unconstitutional. There is a $10.7 billion international arbitration case underway — Prospera's operators arguing that Honduras cannot unilaterally revoke the legal framework that the zone was built on, Honduras arguing that it absolutely can. The outcome of that case will determine whether Prospera continues to exist in its current form or gets absorbed back into the Honduran regulatory mainstream.

For Infinita City, this is an existential dependency. Every resident, every startup, every dollar invested operates under the assumption that Prospera's legal autonomy will survive. If it does not, the entire regulatory sandbox disappears, and with it the core value proposition.

There is also the reputational challenge. MIT Technology Review and other outlets have covered the more controversial aspects of the biotech work happening in and around Prospera — including unregulated gene therapy testing. For the longevity movement broadly, these stories create a tension between the desire for regulatory freedom and the need for credibility. Moving fast is an advantage only if the results hold up to scrutiny. If early experiments produce bad outcomes or attract the wrong kind of attention, the damage extends far beyond one community on one island.

Infinita's greatest strength is that it is real. It has residents, buildings, funded companies, and a functioning regulatory environment. Its greatest weakness is that all of it depends on one jurisdiction surviving one legal battle.

<div class="section-divider"></div>

## Viva City: The Network State Bet

Viva City is playing a fundamentally different game. Where Infinita went deep in one location, Viva is going wide. Where Infinita built on top of an existing charter city, Viva is building a community first and looking for a jurisdiction second.

The tagline is maximally ambitious: "A community building a new city to make death optional." But the execution strategy is pragmatic, even cautious. Rather than committing everything to a single site, Viva is pursuing what it calls a "Seed Tower" model — establishing physical presences in major cities around the world while searching for a permanent home.

<figure>

<figcaption>The Viva Frontier Seed Tower at 995 Market Street, San Francisco — a $11M vertical village housing 200 members across themed floors</figcaption>
</figure>

The first Seed Tower is the Viva Frontier Tower: a 16-story building at 995 Market Street in San Francisco, purchased for $11 million (the building was assessed at $62 million back in 2016, giving you a sense of either the deal or the state of San Francisco commercial real estate). The building is organized as a "vertical village" with 200 members, floors themed around different domains: Robotics, Biotech (including a BioPunk wet lab), Longevity, Crypto, and AI.

Membership runs $1,980 to $2,280 per year — orders of magnitude more accessible than Infinita's $88,888 citizenship. This is a deliberate choice. Viva is optimizing for community breadth at this stage, not revenue per member.

<div class="stat-banner reveal">
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">200</span><span class="stat-label">Members</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">$11M</span><span class="stat-label">Building Investment</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">$1,980–2,280</span><span class="stat-label">Annual Membership</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">$2M</span><span class="stat-label">Finder's Fee</span></div>
</div>

The programming reflects a community still in formation. A popup village ran from June through August 2025 — a six-week program with tracks in AI, Crypto, and Longevity that functioned as both a community-building exercise and a talent filter. The "Longevity Manhattan Project" branding signals the level of ambition, even if the organizational structure is still emerging.

Perhaps the most telling detail is the $2 million finder's fee Viva is offering to anyone who can help secure a permanent location or jurisdiction. That bounty is an honest admission of the project's current stage: we have the community, we have the vision, but we do not yet have the place. It also signals resourcefulness — using market incentives to solve the hardest problem rather than pretending it is already solved.

<div class="callout reveal">
<strong>Key Insight</strong>
<p>The $2 million finder's fee is one of the most honest signals in the longevity jurisdiction space. Rather than pretending the jurisdiction problem is solved, Viva is openly acknowledging it as the hardest remaining challenge and using market incentives to crowdsource the solution.</p>
</div>

<div class="section-divider"></div>

### The Location Paradox

Viva's strength is its optionality. By not committing to a single jurisdiction, it avoids the kind of existential risk that Infinita carries with the Honduras arbitration case. If one location does not work out, the community can relocate. The Seed Tower model means the community continues to exist and grow regardless of where the permanent home ends up.

But that optionality comes at a cost. Without a dedicated regulatory sandbox, Viva cannot offer the kind of experimental freedom that makes Infinita attractive to biotech startups. A building in San Francisco, no matter how creatively organized, still operates under California and federal regulations. You can build community there. You can do research there. But you cannot run the kind of unregulated biotech experimentation that is Infinita's core proposition.

Viva is fundamentally earlier stage. It has more members but less infrastructure. It has more flexibility but less regulatory power. It has a smarter risk profile but a longer road to its stated goal.

## Head to Head

Looking at the two projects side by side clarifies the tradeoffs each has made.

<div class="compare-grid reveal">
<div class="compare-card"><h4>Infinita City</h4><p>Charter city in Honduras with a live regulatory sandbox, 89 residents, $25M raised, and $88,888 citizenship — high commitment, high regulatory power, but existentially dependent on a single jurisdiction surviving legal challenge.</p></div>
<div class="compare-card accent"><h4>Viva City</h4><p>Distributed network state with a San Francisco Seed Tower, 200 members, $11M invested, and sub-$2,300 membership — optimized for community scale and resilience, but without regulatory autonomy until a permanent jurisdiction is secured.</p></div>
</div>

**Location Strategy.** Infinita is concentrated in a single charter city with a functioning regulatory sandbox. Viva is distributed across Seed Towers with no permanent jurisdiction yet secured. Infinita has more power today; Viva has more resilience tomorrow.

**Governance Model.** Infinita operates within Prospera's existing charter city framework — established rules, established courts, established arbitration. Viva is still defining its governance model, drawing from network state concepts but without a formal legal structure for self-governance.

**Funding and Economics.** Infinita has raised $25 million and prices citizenship at $88,888, creating a high-commitment, high-resource community. Viva purchased a building for $11 million and charges under $2,300 per year, optimizing for scale and accessibility.

**Community Size.** Infinita has 89 permanent residents and over a thousand visitors. Viva has 200 members. The comparison is not straightforward — Infinita's residents live there full-time while many of Viva's members are part-time participants — but both have achieved critical mass for their respective models.

**Regulatory Innovation.** This is where Infinita has a clear lead. Prospera's ZEDE framework enables genuine regulatory experimentation in biotech. Viva, operating in San Francisco, has no regulatory advantages. Until Viva secures its own jurisdiction, it cannot match Infinita's value proposition for researchers who need regulatory freedom.

**Risk Profile.** Infinita's risk is concentrated and binary: if the Honduras arbitration goes badly, the project faces an existential crisis. Viva's risk is diffuse and manageable: the project can survive the loss of any single location, but it may struggle to ever achieve the regulatory autonomy that makes the whole exercise worthwhile.

<div class="section-divider"></div>

## The Broader Landscape

Infinita and Viva are the most visible players in the longevity jurisdiction space, but they are not alone.

**VitaDAO** represents a fully digital approach. Rather than building a physical city, VitaDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that funds longevity research directly through token-based governance. It does not need a jurisdiction because it is not doing the research itself — it is funding researchers who operate within existing frameworks. It is a treasury and a governance mechanism, not a place. This makes it far less ambitious in terms of governance innovation but far more immediately functional.

**Bryan Johnson and Blueprint** represent the individual protocol approach. Johnson has turned his own body into a longevity research project, spending millions on an aggressive anti-aging regimen and publishing every result. This is not jurisdictional innovation — it is one extremely wealthy person pushing the boundaries of what is possible within existing regulatory frameworks. But it generates enormous public attention for the longevity cause, and attention eventually translates into political and regulatory pressure.

**Edge City and its Vital Futures track** operate in the popup village model — temporary gatherings that bring longevity researchers together for intensive collaboration. These events do not attempt to create new jurisdictions, but they serve as talent incubators and network builders for the projects that do.

Each of these approaches attacks a different piece of the problem. VitaDAO addresses funding. Blueprint addresses public awareness. Edge City addresses community formation. Infinita and Viva are the ones attempting the hardest thing: building entirely new regulatory environments from scratch.

## What This Actually Means

Step back from the specific projects and the picture becomes clearer. The race to build a longevity jurisdiction is not really about longevity. It is about a much bigger question: can new governance models accelerate science?

<figure>
<img src="/assets/blog/longevity-jurisdiction-race/dna-science.jpg" alt="DNA double helix and scientific research" />
<figcaption>The central question is not whether we have the science to extend life — it is whether regulation will let us use it in time</figcaption>
</figure>

The implicit argument behind both Infinita and Viva is that the primary bottleneck in medical research is not money. It is not talent. It is not even knowledge. It is regulation. The FDA approval process takes an average of 10-15 years and costs over $2 billion per drug. For diseases of aging, the regulatory environment is even more hostile — aging is not classified as a disease, so therapies targeting it face additional categorical hurdles before the standard approval process even begins.

<div class="callout reveal">
<strong>Key Insight</strong>
<p>If regulation really is the binding constraint on longevity science — and the FDA's 10-15 year, $2B+ approval pipeline suggests it may be — then jurisdictional innovation is not a sideshow. It is the main event. The first jurisdiction to prove that faster regulatory pathways produce safe, effective therapies will reshape the entire global regulatory landscape.</p>
</div>

If that diagnosis is correct — if regulation really is the binding constraint — then jurisdictional innovation is not a sideshow. It is the main event. A charter city or network state that successfully creates a faster, safer pathway for longevity research would not just help the people living there. It would create competitive pressure on traditional regulatory systems worldwide. If therapies developed in a longevity jurisdiction prove safe and effective, the FDA and its equivalents will face enormous pressure to explain why their process takes a decade longer.

This is the theory. What matters now is whether either project can prove it in practice.

Infinita has the advantage of operating inside a real regulatory sandbox, with real companies doing real research under a different set of rules. If Prospera survives its legal challenges, Infinita could produce the first concrete evidence that regulatory innovation accelerates longevity science. That evidence would be transformative.

<blockquote class="pull-quote reveal">
<p>The longevity jurisdiction that eventually succeeds will probably combine elements of both — a permanent physical location with genuine regulatory independence, supported by a global network of aligned communities.</p>
</blockquote>

Viva has the advantage of resilience and patience. Even if the first attempt at securing a jurisdiction does not work out, the community survives, the network grows, and the search continues. In a domain where the research itself spans decades, building a durable community may matter more than having a regulatory sandbox today.

The most likely outcome is that both approaches contribute something essential. Physical charter cities with regulatory autonomy provide the experimental environment. Distributed network state communities provide the talent pipeline and political momentum. The longevity jurisdiction that eventually succeeds will probably combine elements of both — a permanent physical location with genuine regulatory independence, supported by a global network of aligned communities.

We are watching this in real time. Two projects, born from the same community, testing two theories of change against the hardest problem in governance innovation. One stayed on an island in Honduras. The other set up shop in the heart of San Francisco. Neither has won yet. Neither has failed yet.

The race is just getting started.
