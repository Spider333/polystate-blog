The network state thesis is simple: start with an online community, align it around shared values, crowdfund territory, and eventually gain diplomatic recognition. Balaji Srinivasan laid this out in *The Network State* in 2022, and the idea lit a fire under a generation of builders who were already skeptical of the nation-state model.

Three years later, we can stop debating the theory. Multiple teams are actually trying to build these things. Some are further along than you might expect. Others have stalled in ways that are instructive. And a few are doing something genuinely new that doesn't fit neatly into Balaji's original framework.

<div class="callout reveal">
<strong>Key Insight</strong>
<p>The network state movement has moved beyond theory into active experimentation. Four distinct projects represent four very different strategies -- pop-up cities, permanent settlements, cultural identity, and education pipelines. Each is stress-testing a different part of the thesis.</p>
</div>

Here's an honest look at four projects that represent the current frontier of network state building -- where they are, what they've proven, and where they might break.

## 1. Zuzalu: The Pop-Up City That Launched a Movement

In the spring of 2023, Vitalik Buterin did something unusual even by his standards. He quietly organized a two-month pop-up city in Lustica Bay, Montenegro, inviting roughly 200 residents at a time -- around 700 participants total over the full run. The experiment was called Zuzalu, and it became the proof of concept that an entire ecosystem now builds on.

<figure class="blog-image">
<img src="/assets/blog/network-state-prototypes/montenegro-coast.jpg" alt="Montenegro coastline where Zuzalu took place">
<figcaption>Lustica Bay, Montenegro -- the coastal setting where Zuzalu proved that pop-up cities could attract world-class talent and produce real output.</figcaption>
</figure>

The format was deceptively simple: co-living, co-working, and a dense calendar of talks and workshops at the intersection of crypto, longevity research, AI safety, and governance experimentation. Residents used ZuPass, a zero-knowledge proof identity system that let them verify membership and attend events without revealing personal data. It was privacy-preserving identity infrastructure tested in the wild, not on a testnet.

<div class="stat-banner reveal">
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">700+</span><span class="stat-label">Participants</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">20+</span><span class="stat-label">Spinoff Events</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">2</span><span class="stat-label">Months in Montenegro</span></div>
</div>

What made Zuzalu significant wasn't any single breakthrough. It was the cross-pollination. Biotech researchers sat next to Ethereum core developers. Governance theorists argued with seasoned founders over dinner. The kind of interdisciplinary collision that universities promise but rarely deliver happened organically because everyone was living together, eating together, and building together for weeks on end.

The downstream effects have been substantial. Zuzalu spawned over 20 "Zu-village" spinoffs worldwide -- Edge City in various locations, Zu-Village Georgia, Edge Esmeralda in California, and many others. Edge City, in particular, has evolved into something like a franchise model for pop-up cities, running multi-week residencies that attract serious builders rather than conference tourists.

But let's be precise about what Zuzalu proved and what it didn't. It proved that pop-up cities work as a *format*. It demonstrated that you can assemble a high-caliber community around shared intellectual interests, give them temporary physical infrastructure, and generate real output -- projects funded, papers written, companies started, relationships formed.

What it didn't prove is that this format can scale into anything resembling governance. Zuzalu had no formal decision-making process. There was no citizenship framework beyond invitation. The "state" part of the network state equation remains largely untouched. Vitalik himself has been careful not to overclaim, positioning these experiments as explorations rather than nation-building.

<div class="callout reveal">
<strong>Key Insight</strong>
<p>Zuzalu's greatest contribution may not be the event itself, but the ecosystem it spawned. Over 20 spinoff communities worldwide now share tools, practices, and alumni networks -- creating a decentralized "network archipelago" that is more resilient than any single project.</p>
</div>

The Zuzalu/Edge City ecosystem is, in many ways, the most intellectually honest project on this list. It's iterating on format, building real tools (ZuPass is genuinely useful infrastructure), and not pretending to be further along than it is. The risk is that it remains permanently in "experiment" mode -- a lovely series of temporary gatherings that never coalesces into something with staying power and actual governance.

<div class="section-divider"></div>

## 2. Infinita City: The Permanent Bet on Longevity and Sovereignty

If Zuzalu is the pop-up experiment, Infinita City is the permanent installation. Based in Prospera, a special economic zone on the island of Roatan, Honduras, Infinita is building a longevity-focused network city with real residents, real startups, and real stakes.

<figure class="blog-image">
<img src="/assets/blog/network-state-prototypes/tropical-island.jpg" alt="Tropical island setting of Infinita City on Roatan">
<figcaption>Roatan, Honduras -- where Infinita City is building a permanent longevity-focused community inside Prospera's special economic zone.</figcaption>
</figure>

The project was originally known as Vitalia and went through a notable split in January 2025. Niklas Anzinger, the driving force behind the longevity city concept, stayed and rebranded to Infinita City. Laurence Ion, his co-founder, departed to launch Viva City with a different vision. These kinds of founder splits are common in startups, but in network state building they carry extra weight -- the community *is* the product, and fractures in leadership become fractures in the social fabric.

<div class="stat-banner reveal">
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">89</span><span class="stat-label">Permanent Residents</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">$25M</span><span class="stat-label">Raised by Residents</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">21</span><span class="stat-label">Funded Startups</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">$88,888</span><span class="stat-label">Citizenship Cost</span></div>
</div>

Despite the split, Infinita's numbers are real and worth paying attention to. Eighty-nine permanent residents. Twenty-one funded startups operating within the community. Twenty-five million dollars raised by residents for their ventures. A $LIVES token economy that creates internal economic coordination. And a citizenship model priced at $88,888 -- high enough to signal serious commitment, potentially high enough to limit growth.

The longevity angle gives Infinita something most network state projects lack: a concrete, measurable mission. They're not just building "a better society" in the abstract. They're creating a regulatory environment where longevity research can move faster than traditional jurisdictions allow. Bryan Johnson, the don't-die poster child, has visited. The biotech pipeline is real.

But Infinita has a massive single point of failure, and everyone involved knows it. The entire project sits within Prospera's legal framework, and Prospera is locked in a $10.7 billion international arbitration case with the Honduran government. Honduras passed legislation in 2022 to repeal the ZEDE (Zone for Employment and Economic Development) framework that gives Prospera its legal basis. Prospera's operators argue that international investment treaties protect them. The case is working through arbitration, but the outcome is genuinely uncertain.

If Prospera's legal standing holds, Infinita could become the most advanced network state prototype in the world -- a permanent community with its own economic system, regulatory framework, and shared mission. If Prospera loses, Infinita's residents will need to find a new jurisdiction fast. Building a city on someone else's experimental legal framework is bold. It's also fragile.

## 3. Afropolitan: The Vision That Hasn't Shipped

Afropolitan entered the network state conversation with one of the most compelling narratives in the space. A digital nation for the African diaspora. A pan-African identity layer that could connect 140 million people spread across the globe. A homeland that exists in the cloud first and in territory later.

The pitch worked. In 2022, Afropolitan raised a $2.1 million seed round led by Balaji Srinivasan himself -- the godfather of the network state thesis putting his money where his book was. The cultural resonance was undeniable. While most network state projects appeal to a narrow slice of crypto-native libertarians, Afropolitan spoke to a genuine, deep, historically rooted desire for belonging and self-determination.

That was three years ago. And the execution gap since then has been painful to watch.

As of early 2026, Afropolitan has not shipped a super app. There is no governance infrastructure. There has been no land acquisition. The tangible outputs have been a dating app priced at $49 per month and a series of mentoring sessions. For a project that raised money to build a digital nation, these deliverables are hard to defend.

To be fair, what Afropolitan is attempting is genuinely difficult. Building a pan-African digital identity system, a governance framework that respects the diversity of African cultures, and a path to physical territory -- any one of these would be a decade-long undertaking. The ambition isn't the problem. The gap between ambition and shipping velocity is.

The charitable read is that Afropolitan is in a long incubation phase, building community and cultural infrastructure that will eventually support more tangible products. The less charitable read is that the project has lost momentum, and community patience has a shelf life.

The vision remains powerful. If someone can build a digital homeland for the African diaspora with real governance, real economic tools, and eventually real territory, it would be one of the most significant social experiments of the century. But vision without execution is just a pitch deck. Afropolitan needs to ship something substantial soon, or the window of credibility will close.

## 4. Network School: Training the Builders

Balaji Srinivasan doesn't just theorize. After writing the book, he started building. Network School, based in Forest City, Malaysia, is his education-first approach to network state building. The thesis: before you can build new countries, you need to train the people who will build them.

<figure class="blog-image">
<img src="/assets/blog/network-state-prototypes/malaysia-city.jpg" alt="Forest City, Malaysia -- home of Network School">
<figcaption>Forest City, Malaysia -- the ghost town turned launchpad where Balaji's Network School trains the next generation of network state builders.</figcaption>
</figure>

The model is branded as "Learn, Burn, Earn, Fun" -- a structured program where members study, exercise (the Bryan Johnson Blueprint partnership handles the health protocol), build projects, and socialize. Version 2 launched in March 2025 with 256 members. Monthly costs run between $1,000 and $2,000, covering housing, meals, gym access, and coursework. For a live-in accelerator experience near Singapore, that's competitive pricing.

The location is strategic. Forest City is a massive, largely empty development in Johor, Malaysia, just across the causeway from Singapore. It was built by Chinese developer Country Garden as a luxury city for Chinese buyers, but capital controls and COVID left it a ghost town. For Network School, this is a feature, not a bug: abundant, cheap, modern infrastructure with proximity to one of Asia's most dynamic economies.

What Network School gets right is sequencing. Instead of trying to build governance, territory, and community simultaneously, it focuses on one thing: producing people who are capable of founding network states. It's a meta-strategy. Train the founders, then let them go build.

The risk is circularity. A school that trains people to build network states is only as valuable as the network states its graduates actually build. So far, the program is young enough that this question remains open. The 256-member cohort is engaged, the curriculum is substantive, and the Bryan Johnson partnership adds a health-optimization angle that differentiates it from a typical co-living space.

But Network School is, by design, a precursor to a network state rather than a network state itself. It has no citizenship framework, no governance model, no territorial ambition. It's an incubator, and it should be judged as one. On those terms, it's executing well.

## The Honest Ranking: Who's Closest?

If we're asking the blunt question -- who is actually closest to building something that resembles a network state? -- here's how these projects stack up.

<div class="compare-grid reveal">
<div class="compare-card accent"><h4>#1 Zuzalu / Edge City</h4><p>Closest to the "startup society → network archipelago" path. Global nodes, real community.</p></div>
<div class="compare-card"><h4>#2 Infinita City</h4><p>Most complete physical implementation. But entirely dependent on Prospera's legal survival.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="compare-grid reveal">
<div class="compare-card"><h4>#3 Network School</h4><p>Best education pipeline. Growing and affordable. But a school, not a state.</p></div>
<div class="compare-card"><h4>#4 Afropolitan</h4><p>Best cultural narrative. But execution has fundamentally stalled after 3 years.</p></div>
</div>

**Tier 1: Zuzalu / Edge City Ecosystem.** The most mature, most intellectually honest, and most generative project in the space. It has produced real infrastructure (ZuPass), real community (thousands of alumni across 20+ spinoffs), and real cultural gravity. It hasn't solved governance, but it's the only project that has reliably produced the *human capital* and *social trust* that governance requires. The ecosystem approach -- many villages, shared tools, no single point of failure -- is more resilient than any single-city bet.

**Tier 2: Infinita City.** The most tangible. Real residents, real startups, real economic activity. If you want to point to a place on a map and say "network state prototype," this is it. But the Prospera dependency is a genuine existential risk, and the post-split community dynamics need time to stabilize. If the arbitration resolves favorably, Infinita jumps to Tier 1 overnight.

**Tier 3: Network School.** Executing well on a deliberately narrow mandate. The education-first strategy is smart sequencing, but it's pre-state by design. Ask again in two years when the first cohorts have graduated and we can see what they build.

**Tier 4: Afropolitan.** The most compelling vision, the weakest execution. Three years post-funding with minimal tangible output is a red flag in any sector. The cultural thesis remains powerful enough that a reset could work, but the current trajectory is concerning.

## What This Tells Us

The network state movement is past the whitepaper phase and into the build phase. That's real progress. But the honest takeaway from surveying these projects is that building new sovereign entities is even harder than the optimists expected.

<div class="callout reveal">
<strong>Key Insight</strong>
<p>The projects that are working share a common trait: they're specific about what they're building and honest about what they haven't figured out yet. The projects that are struggling promised everything at once and delivered on very little.</p>
</div>

The projects that are working share a common trait: they're specific about what they're building and honest about what they haven't figured out yet. Zuzalu doesn't pretend to have governance. Infinita doesn't pretend its legal foundation is certain. Network School doesn't pretend to be a state.

The projects that are struggling share a different trait: they promised everything at once and delivered on very little.

The next two years will be decisive. The Prospera arbitration will resolve. The Edge City network will either develop governance tools or remain a festival circuit. Network School's graduates will either build things or they won't. And Afropolitan will either ship or fade.

We're watching the earliest experiments in a process that will take decades. The question isn't whether network states will exist -- the demand for alternatives to legacy governance is too strong, and the tools are too powerful. The question is which of these early prototypes will survive long enough to prove the model. That's still very much an open question, and pretending otherwise does nobody any favors.
