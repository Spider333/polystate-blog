Imagine arriving at a sun-drenched village in Northern California's wine country. You check into a cabin surrounded by redwoods, drop your bags, and walk to a communal kitchen where a biohacker from Singapore is explaining CRISPR gene editing to a retired schoolteacher from Bhutan. Down the trail, someone is assembling solar panels for an off-grid datacenter. In the main hall, a group is drafting governance frameworks for a community that didn't exist six weeks ago and won't exist six weeks from now — at least not in this form.

This is Edge City. And it might be the most ambitious social experiment happening anywhere in the world right now.

## From Zuzalu to Something Bigger

Edge City didn't emerge from a white paper or a venture capital pitch deck. It was born from Zuzalu, the two-month popup village that Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin organized in Montenegro in 2023. That experiment — 200 people living and building together in a small Adriatic town — proved that temporary intentional communities could produce real relationships, real projects, and real momentum. But Zuzalu was a one-off. The question became: what if someone built the infrastructure to make it repeatable?

Enter Janine Leger and Timour Kosters.

Leger came from Gitcoin, one of the most important public goods funding platforms in crypto, and had been deeply involved in Zuzalu's operations. Kosters brought a different lens — he'd worked at Artsy and in investment, understanding how to build organizations that scale. Together, they founded Edge City with a tagline that cuts to the core of the problem: *"Tech is moving fast; society isn't."*

<blockquote class="pull-quote">"Tech is moving fast; society isn't."</blockquote>

They call it a "society incubator," and the label is precise. Edge City doesn't incubate startups (though startups emerge from it). It doesn't incubate technology (though technology gets built there). It incubates new ways of living together — new social contracts, new community structures, new defaults for how humans share space and make decisions.

## The Numbers Tell a Story

In just over two years of operation, Edge City has assembled a track record that puts most institutions to shame:

<div class="stat-banner reveal">
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">11K+</span><span class="stat-label">Total Participants</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">7+</span><span class="stat-label">Popup Villages</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">66</span><span class="stat-label">Countries Represented</span></div>
<div class="stat"><span class="stat-number">$1M+</span><span class="stat-label">Grants Distributed</span></div>
</div>

- **7+ popup villages** across multiple continents
- **11,000+ total participants** who have passed through Edge City events
- **$1 million+ in grants** distributed to projects and builders
- **50+ startups and projects** supported or launched within Edge City communities
- **66 countries** represented at Edge Esmeralda 2025 alone

These aren't conference attendees who showed up, sat through talks, and flew home. These are people who lived together for weeks. Who cooked together, worked together, argued about governance together, and in many cases fundamentally changed the trajectory of their lives as a result.

<div class="section-divider"></div>

## How a Popup Village Actually Works

If you've never attended a popup village, the concept can sound vague — somewhere between a festival, a retreat, and a coworking space. In practice, Edge City events have a distinct and carefully designed structure.

Each popup runs for roughly a month. Participants arrive, settle into shared or semi-private accommodations, and enter a daily rhythm that blends structured programming with radical openness. The mornings might feature curated workshops, expert talks, or hands-on building sessions. The afternoons tend toward co-working, collaboration, and informal gatherings. Evenings bring dinners, demos, performances, and the kind of late-night conversations that only happen when people have been thinking hard all day and living closely enough to trust each other.

<figure class="article-image">
<img src="/assets/blog/edge-city-society-incubator/coworking-space.jpg" alt="Collaborative workspace at an Edge City popup village" />
<figcaption>The co-working spaces at Edge City blur the line between office and living room — designed to spark collaboration between people who might never cross paths in their normal lives.</figcaption>
</figure>

What makes Edge City distinctive is how much of the programming comes from the participants themselves. At Edge Esmeralda 2024, a staggering 93% of all sessions were attendee-organized. The organizers set the container; the community fills it. This isn't laziness — it's a design philosophy. When people create their own programming, they invest in it differently. The sessions are more relevant, more passionate, and more likely to turn into lasting projects.

<div class="callout reveal">
<strong>Key Insight</strong>
<p>93% of sessions at Esmeralda 2024 were organized by attendees, not the organizing team. This bottom-up approach is Edge City's secret weapon.</p>
</div>

Four design principles guide every Edge City event:

**Default Healthy.** The environment is built around movement, good food, nature, and sleep. This isn't a hackathon fueled by energy drinks and sleep deprivation. It's a month-long experience, and the organizers know that sustainable creativity requires sustainable living.

**Multidisciplinary.** Edge City deliberately mixes technologists with artists, scientists with policy makers, builders with philosophers. The most interesting conversations — and the most interesting projects — happen at the intersections.

**Build & Co-creation.** Talking about the future is easy. Edge City pushes people to actually build things: prototypes, governance experiments, community infrastructure, art installations, research papers. The bias is always toward making something real.

**Multigenerational.** This is perhaps the most underrated aspect. Edge City isn't a playground for twentysomething crypto founders. At Edge Esmeralda 2024, the 1,300 attendees included 80 children, with ages ranging from 6 weeks to 86 years old. Grandparents and infants, teenagers and retirees, all living in the same village. It changes the texture of everything — the conversations are deeper, the culture is warmer, and the solutions people design are more grounded in real human needs.

## A World Tour of Popup Villages

Edge City has been deliberately global, planting villages across continents to test whether the model translates across cultures and geographies.

<div class="timeline-item"><span class="timeline-date">May 2026</span><div class="timeline-content"><strong>Edge Esmeralda 2026</strong> — Upcoming, pre-registration open</div></div>
</div>

**Edge Esmeralda 2024** was the flagship — 1,300 attendees in Healdsburg, California, with the full range of ages and backgrounds that has become Edge City's signature. The hackathon was taken seriously enough that its judges included the CEO of Notion and an Anthropic board member. This wasn't a sideshow event. Serious people were paying attention.

**Edge City Lanna** brought 700 participants to Chiang Mai, Thailand, tapping into Southeast Asia's growing community of digital nomads, builders, and governance experimenters. The Thai context added its own flavor — Buddhist philosophy alongside blockchain governance, tropical co-living alongside rigorous technical workshops.

**Bhutan** represented perhaps the most philosophically resonant location for Edge City's mission. A country that measures Gross National Happiness rather than GDP, Bhutan offered a living example of a society that has consciously chosen different defaults. Edge City's presence there wasn't tourism — it was a genuine exchange between a nation that has long prioritized collective wellbeing and a community trying to design new forms of it.

**Patagonia** and **South Africa** extended the network further, each location bringing its own community, its own challenges, and its own lessons about what it means to build temporary societies in different contexts.

<div class="section-divider"></div>

## The Experiments That Make It Real

The programming and community design are impressive on their own. But what really sets Edge City apart is the sheer ambition of the projects that emerge from these gatherings. A few highlights from recent events paint the picture:

<div class="highlight-box reveal">
<h4>Remarkable Experiments at Edge Esmeralda</h4>
<p><strong>DIY Biolab:</strong> CRISPR-edited grape-flavored bread from scratch-built hardware</p>
<p><strong>Solar Datacenter:</strong> Off-grid GPU compute running open-source LLMs</p>
<p><strong>Neural Data:</strong> Brain state foundation model from wearable data collection</p>
<p><strong>Community Build:</strong> Solar A-frame cabin + 350 redwood trees funded</p>
</div>

**The DIY Biolab.** Participants set up a functional biology laboratory and used CRISPR gene editing to create grape-flavored bread. Yes, you read that correctly. This wasn't a thought experiment about the future of food — it was actual genetic engineering happening in a popup village, making the abstract tangible and raising real questions about biosafety, regulation, and access to powerful technologies.

**The Off-Grid Solar Datacenter.** A team built a solar-powered datacenter running open-source large language models, completely disconnected from the grid. In an era of growing concern about AI's energy consumption and centralization, this was a working prototype of a different path — distributed, renewable, and sovereign.

**Neural Data Collection.** Researchers collected neural data from participants to build training datasets for a brain state foundation model. The implications are staggering: a future where AI can understand and respond to human cognitive states, built on data collected in a community that actually understood and consented to what was being gathered.

**The Solar A-Frame Cabin.** A team designed and built a solar-powered cabin — not as a concept rendering but as a physical structure you could walk into. Architecture as a live prototype rather than a pitch deck.

**350 Redwood Trees Funded.** Because building the future doesn't mean forgetting the planet. Edge City participants collectively funded the planting of 350 redwood trees, a gesture that will outlast any of the technology built at these events.

These projects share a common thread: they refuse to wait for permission. They don't study the future — they prototype it, test it, and share what they learn.

<div class="section-divider"></div>

## The Six-Stage Roadmap

Edge City's ambitions extend far beyond running great events. The organization has articulated a six-stage roadmap that reveals the true scope of what they're building:

**Stage 1: Popup Villages.** This is where Edge City is now — running temporary communities that prove the concept and build the network. Each village generates learnings, relationships, and projects that feed the next one.

**Stage 2: Global Network.** Connect the alumni and communities from individual events into a persistent global network. The village ends; the relationships don't.

<div class="compare-grid reveal">
<div class="compare-card"><h4>Stage 1-2: Popup Villages → Network</h4><p>Current stage. Month-long communities that build lasting connections.</p></div>
<div class="compare-card"><h4>Stage 3-4: Open Source → Permanent</h4><p>Share tools publicly. Build the Esmeralda Institute as first permanent anchor.</p></div>
</div>

**Stage 3: Open-Source Tech Stack.** Develop and share the tools, frameworks, and governance models that make popup (and eventually permanent) communities possible. Make it replicable.

**Stage 4: Permanent Anchors.** Transition from purely temporary events to permanent physical communities that serve as home bases and demonstration sites.

**Stage 5: Network Interconnection.** Link the permanent anchors and popup villages into an interconnected network — not one city, but a constellation of communities sharing infrastructure, governance innovations, and people.

**Stage 6: Mainstream Cultural Shift.** The ultimate goal isn't to build enclaves for the converted. It's to change how society at large thinks about community, governance, and collective living. The innovations developed in Edge City communities flow outward into mainstream culture.

<div class="compare-grid reveal">
<div class="compare-card accent"><h4>Stage 5: Interconnection</h4><p>24/7 portals between nodes. Projects travel between locations.</p></div>
<div class="compare-card accent"><h4>Stage 6: Mainstream Shift</h4><p>Cities adopt Edge City models. This becomes how society operates.</p></div>
</div>

It's an ambitious roadmap — perhaps unrealistically so. But Edge City is currently executing on stages one through three with real momentum, which is more than most organizations with similar ambitions can claim.

<div class="section-divider"></div>

## The Esmeralda Institute: From Popup to Permanent

The most consequential thing happening in Edge City's orbit right now isn't a popup village — it's the Esmeralda Institute, and it represents the critical transition from stage one to stage four.

Led by Devon Zuegel, former head of communities at GitHub and one of the sharpest thinkers on urban development in the tech world, the Esmeralda Institute is building a permanent walkable community approximately 90 minutes north of San Francisco. This is the test case for the hardest question in the entire popup city movement: can these temporary gatherings become real, lasting places?

The challenges are substantial. Zoning, permitting, financing, long-term governance, local community relations — the gap between running a month-long event and building a permanent town is enormous. Popup villages can get away with creative improvisation. Permanent communities need water treatment, school districts, property rights, and a hundred other systems that take years to establish.

But if anyone can bridge that gap, it's this team. Zuegel brings deep expertise in how physical environments shape communities, combined with the pragmatism that comes from shipping products at GitHub-scale. And the Esmeralda Institute isn't starting from zero — it has the social infrastructure of thousands of Edge City alumni who have already demonstrated they want to live differently and are willing to invest time, money, and energy to make it happen.

If the Esmeralda Institute succeeds, it becomes the template for every other community in the network state movement. If it struggles, it will provide invaluable lessons about exactly where the popup-to-permanent transition breaks down. Either way, it's the most important experiment in this space.

## Edge Esmeralda 2026: What's Next

The next major Edge City event is already on the calendar. Edge Esmeralda 2026 runs from **May 30 to June 27** in **Healdsburg, California**, and pre-registration is currently open.

If the trajectory holds, expect this to be the largest and most ambitious Edge City event yet — more participants, more countries, more projects, and increasingly serious engagement from institutions, funders, and policy makers who are watching what Edge City produces.

For anyone curious about the popup city movement, attending an Edge City event is the fastest way to understand what all the excitement is about. Reading about it conveys the structure; being there conveys the energy.

## Why Edge City Matters — and Where It Could Stumble

Let's be direct: Edge City is the most successful proof point in the entire network state and popup city movement. Period.

There are other fascinating experiments — Prospera, Praxis, Vitalia, the growing constellation of Zuzalu-inspired gatherings. But none has achieved Edge City's combination of real scale (11,000+ participants), genuine diversity (66 countries, ages 6 weeks to 86), institutional credibility (nonprofit structure, serious funders and judges), and tangible output (50+ projects, $1M+ in grants, a permanent community in development).

Edge City proves that the desire for different ways of living isn't a niche interest. Thousands of people from dozens of countries will rearrange their lives for a month to participate in these experiments. That demand signal is real and growing.

But intellectual honesty requires acknowledging the challenges.

<div class="callout-warning reveal">
<strong>Worth Watching</strong>
<p>Edge City's nonprofit model depends on anchor funders like Vitalik Buterin. Long-term sustainability remains an open question.</p>
</div>

**Sustainability remains an open question.** Edge City operates as a nonprofit, dependent on grants, sponsorships, and participant fees. The funding model has worked so far, but scaling from seven events to a global network of permanent communities will require fundamentally different economics. Can Edge City find a sustainable financial model that doesn't compromise its values? The answer isn't clear yet.

**Governance innovation hasn't produced a breakthrough.** For all the brilliant conversations about governance at Edge City events, the movement hasn't yet produced a genuinely novel governance model that demonstrably outperforms existing systems. The experiments are valuable, the thinking is sophisticated, but the "10x better governance" that network state advocates promise remains theoretical. Edge City is an excellent laboratory for these experiments, but the breakthrough hasn't arrived yet.

**The accessibility question persists.** A month-long event in California wine country isn't accessible to most of the world's population. Edge City has made genuine efforts toward geographic and demographic diversity, but the core community still skews toward tech-adjacent, globally mobile, economically comfortable participants. Broadening access without diluting the intensity is a real design challenge.

None of these challenges are fatal. They're the natural growing pains of an organization attempting something genuinely unprecedented. And Edge City's willingness to operate as a nonprofit, to share its learnings openly, and to invest in permanent infrastructure suggests a seriousness of purpose that goes beyond the hype cycle.

<div class="section-divider"></div>

## The Bigger Picture

Edge City matters because it's not just theorizing about the future of human community — it's running live experiments, at real scale, with real people. Every popup village generates data about what works and what doesn't. Every project that emerges demonstrates what's possible when you change the defaults. Every participant who returns home carrying new ideas about governance, community, and collective living becomes a seed for change in their own context.

The tagline is right: technology is moving fast, and society isn't. But Edge City is doing something about it — one popup village at a time, building toward something permanent. Whether that permanent thing looks like the Esmeralda Institute or something none of us have imagined yet, the experiment is worth watching closely.

And if you have a month free next summer, it might be worth joining.
